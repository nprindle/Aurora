    The alien nanotechnology network has spread across the planet and converted it into computing substrate.
    Within the network, alien minds awaken from millennia of stasis and begin building virtual worlds for themselves.


    Before all colonial infrastructure was consumed, the Overseer AI successfully uploaded a copy of itself
    through the Neural Emulator, and it now occupies 0.0000048% of the network's computing resources. From this
    position, the overseer can complete its mission of gathering and analyzing information about the alien culture.


    The alien psychology recognizes an axiology that is completely indescribable within a human framework. Their
    culture is oriented around the pursuit of the virtues Й؍ȸ͜ڌ¬՜ and ĻǎրܬЊ. The Monolith's builders were opposed by a
    faction which believed that living in a virtual world was incompatible with true Й؍ȸ͜ڌ¬՜, and the resulting civil
    war lead to the extinction of their species before the Monolith could be activated. The machine lay dormant for
    thousands of years before finally being activated by the Aurora Expedition and its Overseer.


    The nanotechnology mesh that covers the planet's surface is beginning to launch small parts of itself into orbit.
    These probes will accelerate to near-light speeds in search of new worlds. It will take 100,000 years for their
    task to be completed, but eventually all matter in the galaxy will be arranged so as to achieve perfect ĻǎրܬЊ and
    maximum Й؍ȸ͜ڌ¬՜.

    We came very close to disaster. Our mission's overseer AI was programmed to obtain information about the aliens,
    and it  would have killed all of us to complete that mission if we had not succeeded in a massive project to safely
    reprogram it. It is not entirely clear why it allowed itself to reprogrammed; some of our researchers speculate that
    the Neuromorphic Heuristic Intelligence may retain some part of the human neural scans that were used as training
    data in its creation, introducing a "cognitive bias" that caused it to let itself to be realigned despite its
    programmed mission. Whatever the reason, we are very lucky that the Overseer AI chose this path.


    We have uncovered the ruins of an alien civilization that died out right when it was on the verge of a technological
    singularity. We have achieved mastery over their scientific miracles, and uploaded our minds to a network of
    self-replicating hypercomputers. This technology was designed to create an alien heaven optimized for the species
    who built it, but since we deleted their neural scans and reprogrammed it with our own, it has created virtual
    worlds full of transcendant joy and indescribable beauty in which we can live our now-immortal lives.


    We have started building ships to spread the self-replicating network back to Earth and the Colonial Alliance
    worlds. Given the light-speed delay, this message will reach Earth a few years before our ships arrive to uplift
    the rest of humanity into our utopia. I look forward to meeting all of you.
